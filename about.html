          <h1>Algorithms Visualization</h1>
          <p>Algorithm Visualization is a web application that visualize and animate some of the popular algorithms to better understand them.</p>
          <p>We tried to implement a useful project for our colleagues and the other students who like us want to learn about algorithms in a better way. Thus, we made it possible to see the algorithm running in front of your eyes and keep track of what's happenning step by step in an animated way.</p>
          <p>We used pure JavaScript to implement this Web Application with some help of HTML and CSS but we didn't use any animation library or so. </p>
          <p>You will find three modes to use this app and the most important one of them is the educational mode as it has the code of the algorithm and a brief description about it beside a log window that tell you the steps being performed.</p>
          <p>We hope you enjoy it and find it useful ✌️</p>
